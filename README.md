I completed all three tasks given in the assignment.
First, I downloaded the Laravel project, set it up on my local system, connected the database, and successfully opened the login page.

For the second task, I created a Python Selenium script that opens the Laravel login page in a browser, fills random email and password 
values automatically, and then closes the browser.

For the third task, I downloaded the provided HTML template, took the app-calendar.html file, and added it into the Laravel project
as a new page. I created a route /html-page and made the page visible inside Laravel.

All tasks were completed successfully and the project runs as expected.
